# IRDConfigSheetParsing
A node.js application that produces and sorts a list of page numbers that meet defined criteria. This list of page numbers is then useful for printing from a pdf application containing IRD configuration sheets. This process alleviates a large quantity of wasted paper and shortens the time spent performing these activities manually.
